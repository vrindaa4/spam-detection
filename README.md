# Spam Detection in SMS Messages
This project is a Spam Detection application built using Machine Learning techniques to classify SMS messages as either Spam or Ham (Not Spam). The application utilizes a dataset containing labeled SMS messages and uses a variety of methods to process the data, extract features, and train a machine learning model to predict whether a message is spam.

Features
Text Preprocessing: Removes punctuation, converts text to lowercase, and performs other text cleaning tasks to prepare the data for training.

Spam Word Frequency Analysis: Identifies the most frequent words in spam messages and visualizes their frequency.

Spam Classification: Uses machine learning algorithms, specifically Logistic Regression, to classify SMS messages as spam or ham.

Confidence Threshold: Allows users to adjust a confidence threshold to fine-tune the classification accuracy.

Interactive User Interface: Built with Streamlit, providing an intuitive front-end to enter SMS messages and classify them as spam or not, with real-time feedback.

Real-Time Model Updates: The model can be retrained with new data, improving its performance over time.

Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language used for building the application.

Scikit-learn: For model building, training, and evaluation.

Streamlit: For building an interactive, user-friendly frontend.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib: For visualizing data and spam word frequencies.

How to Run the Project
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-detection-app.git
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
